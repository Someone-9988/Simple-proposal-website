# Interactive Proposal Website

This is a fun, interactive proposal website created as a collaborative project with a diploma in computer engineering student. I focused on the frontend design using HTML and CSS, while my collaborator implemented the JavaScript interactivity.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The website displays a proposal message and interactive options:

- A div shows: "Will you be mine forever?"  
- Three clickable options: **Yes**, **Other**, and **No**  

## Desktop behavior:
- Hovering over No makes it move away, making it impossible to click  
- Clicking **Yes** shows: "I love you too"  
- Clicking **Other** leads to another set of options with similar hover behavior  
- A cute note at the bottom: "please please please 🥺"  

### Mobile behavior:
- Hover effects are replaced by clicks  
- Clicking **No** displays: "Okay, that's your decision and I respect that"  
- Clicking **Yes** shows: "I love you too"  
- Clicking **Other** shows another set of options with the same interactive behavior

## Features

### My Contribution (Frontend)
- Designed the webpage layout and styling using HTML and CSS  
- Created the responsive div with message and clickable buttons  
- Added visual touches (colors, fonts, spacing) to make it appealing

### Collaborator Contribution (JavaScript)
- Implemented the interactive behavior of buttons:  
  - Moving “No” buttons when hovered on desktop  
  - Showing/hiding messages and new options based on user clicks  
  - Mobile-specific behavior for “No” click messages

## What I Learned
- Designing an interactive webpage layout with HTML and CSS  
- Understanding how frontend elements and JavaScript interact  
- Collaborating on a small real-world project

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser  
3. Interact with the buttons to see the hover effects, messages, and mobile-specific behavior

## Future Improvements
- Learn JavaScript to implement interactivity myself  
- Add more animations or mobile-specific enhancements  
- Optimize layout and visuals
